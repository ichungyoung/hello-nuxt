<h1>Welcome to Jersey Shore Chinese School{{ $t('about.title') }}</h1>


<p>
Jersey Shore Chinese School (JSCS) is a non-profit organization

founded in 1979 by a group of concerned parents of Monmouth

County. The objective of the school is to introduce and promote

interest in the Chinese language, culture and art. JSCS has been

located at William R. Satz School in Holmdel since 1989. Currently,

JSCS has a student population of about 320, consisting of children

ranging from the age of 4 to 18 and adults.
</p>

<p>
The school offers various classes in Chinese language for students

with different levels of proficiency. Mandarin is the main instructional

language in all language classes, including those offered for

non-Mandarin speaking children and adults. In addition to the

language classes, the school provides students with a variety of

cultural programs such as Tai-Chi, brush painting, Chinese

calligraphy, Chinese traditional dance, origami, kirigami, Chinese

Yo-Yo, Chinese chess, GO game, lion dance, and Chinese

instruments like Er-Hu and bamboo flute. The language classes

meet from 9:30am to 11:20am and the cultural classes meet from

11:30am to 12:30noon every Saturday during the regular school year.

<p>
JSCS has constantly been involved in community activities. In recent

years, it has been a consistent contributor in New Jersey Chinese

Festival, Holmdel Community Day, International Festival and Peace

Fair of Brookdale Community College, International Festival for

Senior Citizens at the Bayshore Medical Center and many other

community and charity activities. JSCS always makes itself available

as a community resource for the learning and appreciation of

Chinese language and culture.
